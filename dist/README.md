## Usage

### Creating a Task

#### Method 1: From Block Menu (NEW)

1. Right-click on any block icon in your document
2. Select "Create Recurring Task" from the context menu
3. The task form opens with pre-filled details from the block:
   - Task name extracted from first line of block
   - Time extracted if present (e.g., "09:00", "2:30 PM")
   - Block automatically linked for quick access
4. Complete the task details and click "Save Task"

**Quick Actions for Linked Blocks:**
- If a block already has a task, the menu shows:
  - ✅ Complete Task - Mark task done and reschedule
  - 🕒 Snooze Task - Delay task (15 min, 1 hour, or tomorrow)

#### Method 2: From Dashboard

1. Open the "Recurring Tasks" dock panel
2. Navigate to the "All Tasks" tab
3. Click "Create New Task"
4. Fill in task details:
   - Task name
   - Due date & time
   - Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Interval (e.g., every 2 weeks)
   - Optional: Link to a block, add tags, set priority
5. Click "Save Task"

### Configuring Notifications

1. Click the ⚙️ Settings button in the dashboard header
2. Enable desired notification channels
3. Configure each channel:
   - **n8n**: Enter your webhook URL
   - **Telegram**: Enter bot token and chat ID
   - **Gmail**: Configure OAuth credentials and recipient email
4. Test each channel before saving
5. Click "Save Settings"

### Managing Tasks

- **Today & Overdue Tab**: View and complete tasks due today or earlier
- **All Tasks Tab**: View all recurring tasks, edit, delete, or toggle enabled/disabled
- **Timeline Tab**: Visual calendar view of upcoming tasks
- **Block Context Menu**: Right-click any block with a linked task for quick actions

### Missed Task Recovery (NEW)

The plugin now automatically recovers missed tasks after being offline:

- When the plugin restarts, it checks for tasks that were due while offline
- All missed occurrences are detected and notifications are sent
- Overdue tasks are automatically advanced to their next future occurrence
- No manual intervention needed - recovery happens automatically

**Example:** If your plugin was offline for 3 days and a daily task was due at 9 AM each day:
- You'll receive notifications for all 3 missed days
- The task will be rescheduled to tomorrow at 9 AM
